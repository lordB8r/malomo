## Notes

### Backend (Elixir and Phoenix)

- Shipments table: 
    - tracking number (tracking_code :: String.t)
    - carrier name (carrier_name :: String.t)
    - latest status (latest_status :: String.t)
    
    `mix phx.gen.schema Shipments.Shipments shipment tracking_code:string carrier_name:string status:string tracking_sim_id:string`
    - create tests to validate 
    
- Shipment Events table:
    - shipment_uuid (shipment_id :: String.t)
    - status (string)
    - changed_at (datetime) (updated_at :: datetime)
    
    `mix phx.gen.schema Shipments.ShipmentEvents shipment_event shipment_id:references:shipments description:string`
    - create tests to validate

- TrackingSim Endpoint with Behaviour
    - create_tracker(code, carrier)
    - get_status(id)

- Use Oban for job qeueing
    - Maybe use Hammer to rate limit

- API endpoint 
    - accepts a tracking number and carrier name, 
    - uses the TrackingSim API to create a tracker for the shipment.
        ```json
        {
            "carrier": "usps",
            "status": "pre_transit",
            "tracking_code": "DE1233444098912831"
        }
    - create tests for API
    - create tests for Oban

- Frontend dashboard
    - React components
    - onSubmit
    - onClick

### Missing pieces

1. Did not work on rate limiter issue
2. 

### Notes from Malomo
Tracking code and tracking number are interchangeable.

The shipment_id is just a foreign key to the shipments table, but you can structure the relationships anyway you see fit. 

The tracker id is the id of the tracker you create on TrackingSim (youâ€™ll get it when interacting with the API)
