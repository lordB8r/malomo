# Backend

This is where the API Server code lives.

## Setup

This project uses [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager and includes a `.tool-versions` file to easily install Elixir and Erlang.

To install the runtime for this project, cd into the `backend/` folder, and run:

```bash
asdf install
```

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies and set up your database by running `mix setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
